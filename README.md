# ECG Classification Using Phase-Folded Feature Extraction

This repository contains code, data, and results from my Master's thesis project on ECG classification using phase-folded waveform parameterisation. The project explores the extraction of interpretable ECG features from the PTB-XL dataset and evaluates model performance in both multiclass and binary classification tasks.

## Project Overview
- Developed a custom **phase-folding approach** to extract temporal and amplitude features from 12-lead ECG signals.
- Performed ML by using the extracted ECG parameters as features and disease superclasses as outcomes. 
- Evaluated model performance using **LightGBM** for both binary (NORM vs ABNORMAL) and multiclass classification across diagnostic superclasses (e.g., NORM, STTC, MI, CD, HYP).
- Compared extracted features with existing benchmark datasets, including **EcgDeli** and **UniG**, using **Pearson cross-correlation**.

## Key Findings
- Binary Classification achieved the highest accuracy of 83%, and Multiclass Classification had 68%.
- Best performance on **Normal** and **STTC** classes (F1-scores of 82% and 69%)
- Lower performance on **MI**, **HYP**, and **CD**, influenced by **class imbalance**
- Strong correlation between phase-folded features and EcgDeli/UniG (e.g., R amplitude: 95%)
